# Logical Problems

Practice repository for improving problem solving skills in programming.

This repo contains my solutions to logical / coding challenges from multiple platforms as part of my journey from the start of my IT career.

---

## Main Goal

- **Build strong problem-solving skills**
- **Practice data structures and algorithms**
- **Solve problems from multiple coding platforms**
- **Track my learning progress over time**

---

## Problem Sources

- **LeetCode** – algorithm and data structure problems
- **HackerRank** – practice challenges and contests
- **Other logical problems** – custom / interview-style questions

---

## Repository Structure

The exact structure may change as I grow this repo, but in general you can expect folders like:

- `leetcode/` – solutions to LeetCode problems
- `hackerrank/` – solutions to HackerRank problems
- `logical/` – general logical / puzzle-style questions
- `datastructures/` – implementations and practice for data structures

Each file typically contains:

- **Problem name / link (in comments)**
- **My solution implementation**
- **Sometimes alternative approaches or optimizations**

---

## Technologies / Languages

Languages may evolve over time, but common ones include:

- `Python`
- `Java`
- `C++` / `C`
- Any other language I use while learning

---

## How to Use This Repo

- **Browse** the folders to find problems and solutions
- **Open** a file to see how I approached the problem
- **Run** the code locally to test or modify it
- **Compare** different solutions / optimizations as the repo grows

This repo is mainly for my personal learning, but you are welcome to explore and learn from it too.

## Notes

- I am continuously adding new problems as I practice.
- Code quality and structure will improve as I gain more experience.

Feel free to suggest improvements or new problems I should try.
